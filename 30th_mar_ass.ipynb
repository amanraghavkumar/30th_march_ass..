    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines the penalties of both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques. It is particularly useful when there are multiple features that are correlated with each other. The objective function for Elastic Net Regression is a combination of the L1 and L2 regularization terms along with the ordinary least squares (OLS) loss term.\n",

    "The main difference from other regression techniques, such as Lasso and Ridge regression, is that Elastic Net uses a linear combination of both L1 and L2 regularization penalties. This allows it to handle situations where there are many correlated features, which can be problematic for Lasso regression alone."

Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on different combinations of training and validation sets, and evaluating its performance. Grid search or randomized search can be used to explore different combinations of alpha and l1_ratio values, and the combination that gives the best performance (e.g., lowest mean squared error) on the validation set is chosen."

This is particularly useful in deployment scenarios where you want to load a pre-trained model without retraining it every time. The pickled model can be stored in a file or sent over the network and then unpickled when needed for prediction."
